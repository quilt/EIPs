## Simple Summary
Account abstraction (AA) allows contracts to pay for user transactions.

## Motivation
Transaction validity is defined rigidly by the protocol, precluding innovation.
Allowing contracts to determine whether they will pay for a transaction makes it
possible for developers to innovate in this area. If alternative requirements
for transaction validity are added over time, Account Abstraction would actually
reduce the protocol's resulting complexity. Over the years, there have been
numerous proposals which would've benefited from contract-defined transaction
validity. From obvious proposals, like multi-sig transaction, to more radical
ones, such as allowing signatures to be batched and verified at the block
level--these can be primarily implemented using Account Abstraction, instead of
being explicitly defined and implemented in every client.

## Specification

After `FORK_BLOCK`, the following changes will be recognized by the protocol.

### New Transaction Type
A new EIP-2718 transaction with type `2` is introduced. Transactions of this
type are referred to as "AA transactions". Their payload should be interpreted
as `rlp([gas_limit, to, data])`.

### `PAYGAS (0xAA)` Opcode

A new opcode `PAYGAS (0xAA)` is introduced. It consumes a single stack element
representing the `gas_price` that the contract is willing to pay for the
subsequent execution. If the contract's balance is at least `gas_price *
tx.gas_limit`, then that amount will subtracted from the contract's balance and
execution will proceed. At the end of execution, the contract will be refunded
for any remaining gas. If the contract's balance is too low, then execution will
revert and the contract will not pay for the execution.

### Execution Semantics

The following semantics are enforced:

* Transactions, other than AA transactions, that call `PAYGAS` are invalid.
* AA transactions that do not call `PAYGAS` are invalid.
* Multiple invocations of `PAYGAS` must cause a revert.
* If `ORIGIN (0x32)` or `CALLER (0x33)` is invoked in the first frame of
  execution of a call initiated by an AA transaction, then it must return
  `0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA`.
* If `ORIGIN (0x32)` is invoked in any other frame of execution of an AA
  transaction it must return `tx.to`.
* If `PAYGAS` is called after any of the following opcodes are encountered, it
  must revert:
    * `BALANCE (0x31)`
    * `GASPRICE (0x3A)`
    * `EXTCODESIZE (0x3B)`
    * `EXTCODECOPY (0x3C)`
    * `EXTCODEHASH (0x3F)`
    * `BLOCKHASH (0x40)`
    * `COINBASE (0x41)`
    * `TIMESTAMP (0x42)`
    * `NUMBER (0x43)`
    * `DIFFICULTY (0x44)`
    * `GASLIMIT (0x45)`
    * `CREATE (0xF0)`
    * `CALL (0xF1)`
    * `CALLCODE (0xF2)`
    * `DELEGATECALL (0xF4)`
    * `STATICCALL (0xFA)`
    * `CREATE2 (0xF5)`
    * `SELFDESTRUCT (0xFF)`
* AA transactions' `tx.to` must be a contract that begins with a prelude that
  verifies `CALLER == 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA`, otherwise the
  transaction is invalid.


### Mining Strategies
TODO

## Rationale

### AA transactions *must* call `PAYGAS`

AA transactions are a special type of transaction that have no signature format
defined by the protocol. Therefore, it's not immediately clear who should pay
for the transaction. Most of the time, a non-paying AA transaction would simply
be dropped. However, it's possible that there are assets controlled by
`0xAA...AA`. This could incentivize a miner to mine a block with an AA
transaction that does not call `PAYGAS`, gaining control of any assets owned by
`0xAA...AA`.

### Disallow opcodes that access external data

An important property of traditional transactions is the ability to validate
them in constant time. This is due to the minimal number of validity
requirements traditional transactions need to have validated (e.g. signature,
nonce, and balance checks).

Allowing AA contracts to access external data before they call `PAYGAS` makes it
possible to write validation logic that depends on a large number of external
values. Although clients can bound the validation computation to some rational
amount with gas, they can't easily bound the number of transactions that depend
on the same, arbitrary data.

This can be extorted to create long, opaque chains of dependent transactions
that can be completely invalidated by a single new transaction. This forces
miners to revalidate each one in the order they intend to include them in a
block, creating a denial-of-service vector.

To avoid this, AA contracts must be validatable in constant time. This is
achieved by removing their ability to rely on data external to their own
account. Miners can then adjust the number of AA transactions they are willing
to validate per account on an as-needed basis.

It's important that this execution semantic is enforced by the protocol and not
just a transaction pool heuristic. If this were not the case, malicious miners
could invalidate an innumerable number of pending transactions with a single
transaction in a malicious, but valid, block.

### AA transactions must call contracts with prelude

The prelude is used to ensure that *only* AA transactions can call the contract.
This is another measure taken to ensure the invariant described above. If this
check did not occur, it would be possible for an internal transaction to call
into many different AA contracts and invalidate an innumerable number of pending
AA transactions.

There are drawbacks to the prelude mechanism. Upgrades to AA in the future may
require modified logic in the prelude, which would require one of the following:
* changing the bytecode in the affect contracts
* changing the semantics of that specific bytecode prefix
* introducing a new version of AA. 

None of these solutions are desirable.

The optimal solution is to recognize AA contracts at the protocol level as a
type of account separate from EOAs and contracts. This would provide the
flexibility to make modifications in the future, without the need to continue
supporting legacy versions. This is not the path taken in this EIP due to the
increased complexity and risk that an additional type would incur. 

## Backwards Compatibility
It is possible that an AA contract does not implement a replay protection
mechanism, allowing a single transaction to be included multiple times on-chain.
This would break the transaction uniqueness invariant currently maintained by
the network and affect downstream applications which rely on this invariant.

We anticipate to resolve this compatibility issue before this EIP reaches a
finalized state, after which there will be no backwards compatibility concerns.

## Security Considerations

Much of the work on this EIP has been focused on addressing the security
concerns that arise in the `tx_pool`. Although the miner strategies laid out
here are not required in a hard fork, they are important for maintaining the
network's resilience.

### Transaction pool validation
When a transaction enters the `tx pool`, the client is able to quickly ascertain
whether the transaction is valid. Once it determines this, it can be confident
that the transaction will continue to be valid unless a transaction from the
same account invalidates it. There are, however, cases where an attacker can
invalidate more transactions worth of computation than they spent to exercise
the attack and where an attacker may inundate a target with invalid
transactions.

#### Block invalidation attack
The attack can be carried out as follows. Suppose an adversary has deployed many
AA contracts. The adversary sends a valid transaction to each of the AA
contracts. Before the transactions can be included in a block, the adversary
releases a block with transactions to each of their AA contracts that invalidate
the pending transactions. The transactions in the block can be very minimal,
just enough to update a nonce--whereas the transactions that are pending would
be maximally expensive to validate.

This attack allows the adversary to force clients on the network to perform work
disproportionate to the amount of work paid for on-chain. There is no "solution"
to an attack like this. It's possible to carry out on today's network, but the
cost of validation is so low that is not a concern. Significantly increasing the
amount of computation required for validation gives adversaries a larger attack
surface. This is why it is important for miners to follow the recommended mining
strategies as they will minimize their vulnerability to attacks of this type.

#### Peer denial-of-service
Denial-of-Service attacks are difficult to defend, due to the difficulty in
identifying sybils within a peer list. At any moment, one may decide (or be
bribed) to initiate an attack. This is not a problem that Account Abstraction
introduces. It can be accomplished against existing clients today by inundating
a target with transactions whose signatures are invalid. However, due increased
allotment of validation work allowed to AA, it's important bound the amount of
computation an adversary can force a client to expend with invalid transactions.
For this reason, it's best for the miner to follow the recommended mining
strategies.
